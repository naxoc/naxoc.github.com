  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been doing more CSS and front-end stuff lately. I am having a lot of fun learning more about these things that I have somehow avoided doing for the last many years.</p>

<p>Today I realized that I don&rsquo;t have to own a MS Windows license to run a setup in a VM for browser-testing. While I don&rsquo;t hate Microsoft (anymore) I would really rather not buy a license for a product that I think is horrible. Anyway &ndash; I had no idea that it is super simple to set up a VM running whatever version of IE you want on Windows.</p>

<p>Installing the disk image was easy and I was up and running in very short time. I did however struggle a little with getting Windows to recognize the localhost (my Mac) and the vhosts I have on my local machine. I do all my development on my localhost, so I really needed Windows to understand my vhosts. Here is a writeup of what I did:</p>

<p>Note that I installed Win7 &ndash; the instructions for editing the hosts file might be different on other versions of Windows.</p>

<h2>Install VirtualBox</h2>

<p>First you need to install VirtualBox if you don&rsquo;t have it. Go grab an installer from the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox Downloads page</a> and install it.</p>

<h2>Install the Windows image</h2>

<p>Now go to <a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">modern.ie&rsquo;s download page</a> and download a virtual machine in the IE version you would like to test stuff on. For this writeup I got an IE9 on Win7. Note that instead of downloading a lot of rar-files, you can just grab a cUrl command at the bottom of the downloadboxes and paste that into your terminal.</p>

<p>This part takes a good while, so be patient.</p>

<h2>Configure networking in VirtualBox</h2>

<p>Before you start Windows, you need to configure networking in VirtualBox. So go to VirtualBox and choose &lsquo;Preferences&rsquo; from the menu (or go Command-,). In the settings window &ndash; click &ldquo;Network&rdquo; and choose the &ldquo;Host-only Networks&rdquo; tab. On that tab there is a plus that you just click and accept. I didn&rsquo;t have to configure anything &ndash; I just got a configuration called <em>vboxnet0</em>. Go ahead and close preferences &ndash; this is a onetime setup thing. All images you install will be able to use these settings (if you want).
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/vm/vbox-networks.png" title="'Host-only Networks'" ></p>

<h2>Boot up Windows</h2>

<p> Now you can double click the image in VirtualBox&rsquo;s main window to start up Windows. Yup &ndash; you get the Windows sound.</p>

<h2>Find the Gateway</h2>

<p>Once Windows has booted up we need to configure the image to talk to our localhost. Click the start button or whatever it&rsquo;s called and type &lsquo;cmd&rsquo; in the textfield to get a &ldquo;terminal&rdquo;. Type <code>ipconfig</code> at the prompt and find the part in the output where it says &ldquo;Default Gateway&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection&rdquo;. Note that IP. It should be something like 10.0.x.x. Mine is 10.0.2.2.</p>

<h2>Set file permissions on the hosts file</h2>

<p>Now we need to edit Windows&#8217; hosts-file so that the vhosts we have on our Mac can be used. But first we have to change the file rights on the file. To open the Finder thingy, type <code>explorer C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</code> in at the prompt. That gives you the folder with the hosts-file. Now right click on that and select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. In the window you get, click the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab and then click the &ldquo;Edit button&rdquo;.
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/vm/win7-edit-file-rights-1.png" title="'File permissions'" >
 Select the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; group/user and tick the &ldquo;Full control&rdquo; box.
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/vm/win7-edit-file-rights-2.png">
All this probably is a horrible idea securitywise, but I don&rsquo;t really care &ndash; I&rsquo;ll use this Windows install very little. Click save and you&rsquo;re good.</p>

<h2>Edit the hosts file</h2>

<p>Now we can edit the hosts file. Double click on the hosts file and choose Notepad in the &ldquo;Open with dialog&rdquo;. Now you can add the urls that you have set up as vhosts on your Mac. Use the 10.0.x.x IP address from the <code>ipconfig</code> command like this for example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>10.0.2.2 d7.dev 
</span><span class='line'>10.0.2.2 d8.dev </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save the file and you&rsquo;re done! I made a desktop shortcut to the file because I feel like I&rsquo;ll be back for more vhost-editing soon.</p>

<h2>Use IE!</h2>

<p>Now you can see your Mac&rsquo;s webserver&rsquo;s pages from your VM. So open up IE(!) and go to whatever url you put in the hosts file. I just want to point out one last thing: There is a Firebug Lite to be found in (this) IE if you click the gear in the upper right corner.

<p>Hope you found this very verbose walktrough helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>EDIT: <em>It seems that the version 7 early access now has a file watcher preset for Compass &ndash; nice work JetBrains! The part about scope from this blog post is still useful to you if you are on PHPStorm 7 though.</em></p>

<p>I started using PHPStorm about 6 months ago and while it is an extremely awesome and powerful IDE there are just so many things you can set up and configure. I have to admit that for the first couple of months I pretty much used PHPStorm just like I did Vim and not using any of the many configurable things except for the debugger. I am slowly venturing into playing around with setting more stuff up, and I thought I would share this one because it took me a while to get right.</p>

<p>It is super simple to use the <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass compiler</a> from the command line and I always have. But PHPStorm can compile your .scss files into .css on the fly so why not take advantage of that.</p>

<p>So here is what I did. The settings assume that you use something that resembles the default settings in a Compass project with a folder for the scss files and the css being output to another folder called something like &ldquo;stylesheets&rdquo; or &ldquo;css&rdquo; (could be anything really). You also need to have <a href="http://compass-style.org/install/">Compass installed on your machine</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the PHPStorm settings, go to &ldquo;File Watchers&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click the plus to add a watcher and choose SCSS.</li>
<li>Edit the settings to look like the ones on the screenshot. Where Compass is installed on your machine may not be in /usr/bin/compass like it is on mine, but you can use the command <code>whereis compass</code> from your command line to figure out where compass is. The output path is &ldquo;stylesheets&rdquo; for me for this particular project, but you shold edit that to whatever your project has named the css output folder.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/compass-phpstorm.png" title="'Settings in PHPStorm'" ></p>

<p>Note that I have created a &ldquo;scope&rdquo; called Theme. Scopes in PHPStorm are parts of your project that you would like included or excluded in things like searches and settings like this Compass setup. There is no reason for PHPStorm to listen for changes to your module files if your theme folder is where you have your Compass project. So if you click the button with the three dots at the scope field you can setup PHPStorm to only look where it is relevant. I use scopes a lot to cut down on how long searches take, so setting up a few scopes for each project is time well spent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like to keep my code free of trailing whitespace. I feel what xjm describes as &ldquo;<a href="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/review-guide">spinach in your teeth</a>&rdquo; about whitespace and non-conforming coding standards.</p>

<p>I got (heavily) inspired by Josh The Geek&rsquo;s <a href="http://drupal.org/sandbox/JoshTheGeek/1143338">git pre-commit hook</a>, and made myself a commit hook that will check the code I am about to commit for common errors. In addition to whitespace, I like to make sure that I don&rsquo;t accidentally commit debug code like <code>krumo()</code>. The commit hook also checks for common calls to debug functions.</p>

<p>If you want to use it, simply put it in your .git/hooks folder in your git checkout. Make sure the file is executable with <code>chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit</code>. This will only effect the git checkout you put the commit hook in, but you can make it apply to all future checkouts by putting it in your git install directory&rsquo;s template folder. Where that folder is will vary, but on my mac it is in /usr/share/git-core/templates/hooks.</p>

<p>The script is not the most clever in the world, so it will be wrong about some things from time to time. You can override it and still commit with the command <code>git commit -n</code></p>

<p>Here is the pre-commit file: <a href="https://gist.github.com/naxoc/4150599">Gist is here</a> &ndash; I find that the gist plugin for Octopress is horribly broken.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have my LAMP stack and other things set up on my mac with the wonderful <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p>I recently did a <code>brew upgrade</code> on my system and it seemed that everything went smooth. But when I later ran PHP from the command line I got this error:
<code>
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library &lsquo;/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so&rsquo; &ndash; dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libmemcached.9.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so
  Reason: image not found in Unknown on line 0
</code></p>

<p>I poked around in my php.ini to see if the wrong file was being included or something like that, but it turned out that I had upgraded to a newer version of libmemcached than the one memcached was using. So I needed to downgrade libmemcached. Here is how to switch to any version available with Homebrew:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>brew versions libmemcached</code>
</li>
<li>
Find and note the version number you want. In my case I wasn&#8217;t sure, so I just went with the second newest and that worked.
</li>
<li>
<code>brew switch libmemcached 1.0.4</code>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Change the version number and the formula above to whatever makes sense for what you are doing.</p>

<p>The example above is using a command that is an <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands">external command</a> for Homebrew. It works super fast and is easy to use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, Camilla.. Why is your nick everywhere <em>naxoc</em>?.</p>

<p>Xoc means shark in Yucatec Maya. It might actually be <a href="" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec_Maya_language#English_words_derived_from_Maya">one of the very few words that made it into English</a>. I used to study American Indian Language and Culture at the University of Copenhagen. Those were the days with much nerding over Mayan hieroglyphics. Maya hieroglyphic texts are often about how fantastic the rulers where and one of the more fantastic female rulers was called <a href="" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Xoc">Lady Xoc</a>. I thought she was pretty cool, so I stole the name. The Na- prefix is simply a marker for female. So there is the story of my weird nick.</p>

<p>It is pronounced “nashoc”.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel" title="Devel | drupal.org">The Devel module</a> includes the super helpful <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo library</a>. I use <code>dsm()</code> and <code>krumo()</code> all the time. If you are not familiar with Devel, you should try it. Morten Wulff wrote a <a href="https://ratatosk.backpackit.com/pub/1836982-debugging-drupal">demo page for the module</a>.<br/>
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/krumo.png"><br/>
Today a client suggested that the Devel module Krumo could display the &ldquo;path&rdquo; to an item in an array by right clicking or otherwise interacting with the nested elements in the output from Krumo. I was really excited about that idea &ndash; I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have tried and failed to target an item deep in a form array or an item in the node object simply because my human brain can&rsquo;t remember a structure like <code>$form['#node']-&gt;content['links']['comment']['#attributes']['class']</code> for more than 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Still very happy with this new idea I went straight home and started to hack away at the Krumo library to make it display the path to a desired item. After looking at the javascript for a while, and saying out loud that Javascript hates me, I realized that the killer feature I was trying to make already exists in Krumo! This is a well hidden gem that I haven&rsquo;t seen before today, so I thought I would share it:
If you double click an item in the Krumo output it prints the items array &ldquo;path&rdquo; so that you can copy paste it into your code and stop worrying about remembering long array structures.<br/>
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/krumo_path.png" title="'krumo with array path'" >
Thanks to Niels Fanøe for the inspiration.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was using the dev D7 version, and the feature just went in this August. Thanks to Mark Theunissen for pointing that out. I also feel less stupid for not discovering the feature before now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are moving an iTunes library to a new mac it will go smooth if the user login is the same. So if I move my iTunes library from an old machine where it was located in <code>/Users/ckj/iTunes</code> to a new machine where it is gonna go in <code>/Users/ckj/iTunes</code> &ndash; I have no problems. But if I changed to another username on the new machine &ndash; all the paths in the iTunes Library.xml file will not be correct anymore. I have moved libraries so many times now and I thought I would share a really quick way to fix the iTunes Library.xml file to reflect the correct user directory.</p>

<p>If you use the built-in command line tool called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>, you can type one line in the terminal and be done. Let’s say I was moving from a mac with a user directory called &ldquo;ckj&rdquo; to another machine with a user directory called &ldquo;naxoc&rdquo;. All I would have to do in the terminal would be this:</p>

<ol>
<li>cd to the iTunes folder in the user directory you are moving to.</li>
<li>Enter this: <code>sed -i "" -e "s,Users/ckj,Users/naxoc,g" files iTunes\ Library.xml</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Note the funky syntax with the <code>-i ""</code> This is a mac quirck in sed. I found some info on it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2320564/variations-of-sed-between-osx-and-gnu-linux">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My beloved 3years old Macbook Pro was starting to get really hot when I used it. It had gotten to the point where I would burn my legs if it was on my lap, and since having your <em>lap</em>top on the lap is kinda the point, I felt had to do something about it.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Notebook-Cooling-N100-Gray/dp/B003BEDQYY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303933766&amp;sr=8-1%E2%80%9D">Logitech Notebook Cooling Pad</a> that actually is very comfortable and does exactly as it says it will, but I was still curious to see if I could get my old healthy Macbook back.</p>

<p>I found <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://www.andrew.co.za/2008/02/quick-macbook-clean.html%E2%80%9D">this blog post</a> about how to vacuum the laptop and the result is amazing. I was a little worried about the static, so I turned the machine completely off and removed the battery before vacuuming. The happy laptop is now quieter and cooler! Very simple and very recommended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a lot of pet peeves when it comes to programming, databases, web content, food, beer, and, well just about everyting. I am thinking of making a series of pet peeves here on this site. Some will seem like plain rants, and others will be more like tips.</p>

<p>When making comparisons, switch the order of the things you compare like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;book&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Stuff happens.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You might think why? And that looks weird! Yes, it does look a little weird. But I do this to not accidentially assign the $node->type the value I am comparing it with. It is hell to find an error like this when debugging:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;book&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Stuff happens whether you like it or not.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>See what happened? I only put one = instead of two. PHP will not complain about this, I will just not get what I expect. If I had switched the items, PHP would have complained as I tried to assign an object to a non-variable.</p>
