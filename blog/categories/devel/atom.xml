    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel" title="Devel | drupal.org">The Devel module</a> includes the super helpful <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo library</a>. I use <code>dsm()</code> and <code>krumo()</code> all the time. If you are not familiar with Devel, you should try it. Morten Wulff wrote a <a href="https://ratatosk.backpackit.com/pub/1836982-debugging-drupal">demo page for the module</a>.<br/>

Today a client suggested that the Devel module Krumo could display the &ldquo;path&rdquo; to an item in an array by right clicking or otherwise interacting with the nested elements in the output from Krumo. I was really excited about that idea &ndash; I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have tried and failed to target an item deep in a form array or an item in the node object simply because my human brain can&rsquo;t remember a structure like <code>$form['#node']-&gt;content['links']['comment']['#attributes']['class']</code> for more than 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Still very happy with this new idea I went straight home and started to hack away at the Krumo library to make it display the path to a desired item. After looking at the javascript for a while, and saying out loud that Javascript hates me, I realized that the killer feature I was trying to make already exists in Krumo! This is a well hidden gem that I haven&rsquo;t seen before today, so I thought I would share it:
If you double click an item in the Krumo output it prints the items array &ldquo;path&rdquo; so that you can copy paste it into your code and stop worrying about remembering long array structures.<br/>

Thanks to Niels Fan√∏e for the inspiration.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was using the dev D7 version, and the feature just went in this August. Thanks to Mark Theunissen for pointing that out. I also feel less stupid for not discovering the feature before now!</p>
