    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been playing around with Github&rsquo;s new editor <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> for a while now. I actually quite like it, but it still hasn&rsquo;t taken Vim&rsquo;s place as my default editor yet. Maybe it will at some point, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Atom updates itself and that has been working great, only it stopped working a while ago. It threw some long error to the GUI editor that I can&rsquo;t remember and when I tried to run <code>apm upgrade</code> it said:
<code>
➜  ~  apm upgrade
Package Updates Available (0)
└── (empty)
</code>
&mdash; even though in the UI it said it had an update ready.</p>

<p>I poked around a for a while until I found a couple of mentions in the support forums <a href="http://discuss.atom.io/t/cant-install-or-update-packages/1623">like this one</a> saying that you should just set file permissions on your <code>~/.atom/.node-gyp</code> folder. So I did
<code>
chmod -R 777 ~/.atom/.node-gyp
</code>
and restarted the GUI Atom.app. Now my update was applied and everybody was happy again!</p>
