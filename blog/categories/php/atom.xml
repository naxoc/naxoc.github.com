    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am working on a few older Drupal sites that are quite insistent on using PHP 5.3 and not PHP 5.4. No problem &ndash; I&rsquo;ll just use Homebrew to switch between versions! But I have been running into all kinds of problems every time I have done this, so I figured I would post what I do to repair things here.</p>

<p>So, in theory all you should have to do is install the versions you need if you don&rsquo;t already have them.
<code>brew install php53</code>
And when you want to switch just run this:
<code>brew unlink php54 &amp;&amp; brew link php53</code></p>

<p>Apache also needs to know what version to use, so edit <em>/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</em> so that the line that looks like this has the right (major) version number:
<code>LoadModule php5_module /usr/local/opt/php54/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</code></p>

<p>So far so good. You can check the version from the command line:
```
➜  ~  php &mdash;version
PHP 5.3.28 (cli) (built: May  7 2014 09:50:08)
Copyright &copy; 1997-2013 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright &copy; 1998-2013 Zend Technologies</p>

<pre><code>with Xdebug v2.2.5, Copyright (c) 2002-2014, by Derick Rethans
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you are not seeing what you expect, try adding add this to your <em>.bashrc</em> or <em>.zshrc</em> with the correct version number:
 <code>export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php54)/bin:$PATH"</code></p>

<p>If things are working now thats great! It doesn&rsquo;t always for me. I get this:
<code>
➜  ~  php -i
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libpng15.15.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/php53/bin/php
  Reason: image not found
</code>
Sadly the only workaround I have found is to uninstall and install again:
  <code>brew uninstall php53 &amp; brew install php53</code></p>

<p>  It takes quite a long time but it does the trick.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have my LAMP stack and other things set up on my mac with the wonderful <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p>I recently did a <code>brew upgrade</code> on my system and it seemed that everything went smooth. But when I later ran PHP from the command line I got this error:
<code>
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so' - dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libmemcached.9.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so
  Reason: image not found in Unknown on line 0
</code></p>

<p>I poked around in my php.ini to see if the wrong file was being included or something like that, but it turned out that I had upgraded to a newer version of libmemcached than the one memcached was using. So I needed to downgrade libmemcached. Here is how to switch to any version available with Homebrew:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>brew versions libmemcached</code>
</li>
<li>
Find and note the version number you want. In my case I wasn't sure, so I just went with the second newest and that worked.
</li>
<li>
<code>brew switch libmemcached 1.0.4</code>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Change the version number and the formula above to whatever makes sense for what you are doing.</p>

<p>The example above is using a command that is an <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands">external command</a> for Homebrew. It works super fast and is easy to use.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a lot of pet peeves when it comes to programming, databases, web content, food, beer, and, well just about everyting. I am thinking of making a series of pet peeves here on this site. Some will seem like plain rants, and others will be more like tips.</p>

<p>When making comparisons, switch the order of the things you compare like this:
<code>php
if ('book' == $node-&gt;type) {
// Stuff happens.
}
</code>
You might think why? And that looks weird! Yes, it does look a little weird. But I do this to not accidentially assign the $node->type the value I am comparing it with. It is hell to find an error like this when debugging:
<code>php
if ($node-&gt;type = 'book') {
// Stuff happens whether you like it or not.
}
</code>
See what happened? I only put one = instead of two. PHP will not complain about this, I will just not get what I expect. If I had switched the items, PHP would have complained as I tried to assign an object to a non-variable.</p>
