    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have my LAMP stack and other things set up on my mac with the wonderful <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p>I recently did a <code>brew upgrade</code> on my system and it seemed that everything went smooth. But when I later ran PHP from the command line I got this error:
<code>
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library &lsquo;/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so&rsquo; &ndash; dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libmemcached.9.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/memcached-php/2.0.1/memcached.so
  Reason: image not found in Unknown on line 0
</code></p>

<p>I poked around in my php.ini to see if the wrong file was being included or something like that, but it turned out that I had upgraded to a newer version of libmemcached than the one memcached was using. So I needed to downgrade libmemcached. Here is how to switch to any version available with Homebrew:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>brew versions libmemcached</code>
</li>
<li>
Find and note the version number you want. In my case I wasn't sure, so I just went with the second newest and that worked.
</li>
<li>
<code>brew switch libmemcached 1.0.4</code>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Change the version number and the formula above to whatever makes sense for what you are doing.</p>

<p>The example above is using a command that is an <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands">external command</a> for Homebrew. It works super fast and is easy to use.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel" title="Devel | drupal.org">The Devel module</a> includes the super helpful <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo library</a>. I use <code>dsm()</code> and <code>krumo()</code> all the time. If you are not familiar with Devel, you should try it. Morten Wulff wrote a <a href="https://ratatosk.backpackit.com/pub/1836982-debugging-drupal">demo page for the module</a>.<br/>

Today a client suggested that the Devel module Krumo could display the &ldquo;path&rdquo; to an item in an array by right clicking or otherwise interacting with the nested elements in the output from Krumo. I was really excited about that idea &ndash; I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have tried and failed to target an item deep in a form array or an item in the node object simply because my human brain can&rsquo;t remember a structure like <code>$form['#node']-&gt;content['links']['comment']['#attributes']['class']</code> for more than 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Still very happy with this new idea I went straight home and started to hack away at the Krumo library to make it display the path to a desired item. After looking at the javascript for a while, and saying out loud that Javascript hates me, I realized that the killer feature I was trying to make already exists in Krumo! This is a well hidden gem that I haven&rsquo;t seen before today, so I thought I would share it:
If you double click an item in the Krumo output it prints the items array &ldquo;path&rdquo; so that you can copy paste it into your code and stop worrying about remembering long array structures.<br/>

Thanks to Niels Fan√∏e for the inspiration.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was using the dev D7 version, and the feature just went in this August. Thanks to Mark Theunissen for pointing that out. I also feel less stupid for not discovering the feature before now!</p>
