  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are moving an iTunes library to a new mac it will go smooth if the user login is the same. So if I move my iTunes library from an old machine where it was located in <code>/Users/ckj/iTunes</code> to a new machine where it is gonna go in <code>/Users/ckj/iTunes</code> &ndash; I have no problems. But if I changed to another username on the new machine &ndash; all the paths in the iTunes Library.xml file will not be correct anymore. I have moved libraries so many times now and I thought I would share a really quick way to fix the iTunes Library.xml file to reflect the correct user directory.</p>

<p>If you use the built-in command line tool called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>, you can type one line in the terminal and be done. Let’s say I was moving from a mac with a user directory called &ldquo;ckj&rdquo; to another machine with a user directory called &ldquo;naxoc&rdquo;. All I would have to do in the terminal would be this:</p>

<ol>
<li>cd to the iTunes folder in the user directory you are moving to.</li>
<li>Enter this: <code>sed -i "" -e "s,Users/ckj,Users/naxoc,g" files iTunes\ Library.xml</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Note the funky syntax with the <code>-i ""</code> This is a mac quirck in sed. I found some info on it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2320564/variations-of-sed-between-osx-and-gnu-linux">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My beloved 3years old Macbook Pro was starting to get really hot when I used it. It had gotten to the point where I would burn my legs if it was on my lap, and since having your <em>lap</em>top on the lap is kinda the point, I felt had to do something about it.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Notebook-Cooling-N100-Gray/dp/B003BEDQYY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303933766&amp;sr=8-1%E2%80%9D">Logitech Notebook Cooling Pad</a> that actually is very comfortable and does exactly as it says it will, but I was still curious to see if I could get my old healthy Macbook back.</p>

<p>I found <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://www.andrew.co.za/2008/02/quick-macbook-clean.html%E2%80%9D">this blog post</a> about how to vacuum the laptop and the result is amazing. I was a little worried about the static, so I turned the machine completely off and removed the battery before vacuuming. The happy laptop is now quieter and cooler! Very simple and very recommended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a lot of pet peeves when it comes to programming, databases, web content, food, beer, and, well just about everyting. I am thinking of making a series of pet peeves here on this site. Some will seem like plain rants, and others will be more like tips.</p>

<p>When making comparisons, switch the order of the things you compare like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;book&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Stuff happens.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You might think why? And that looks weird! Yes, it does look a little weird. But I do this to not accidentially assign the $node->type the value I am comparing it with. It is hell to find an error like this when debugging:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;book&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Stuff happens whether you like it or not.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>See what happened? I only put one = instead of two. PHP will not complain about this, I will just not get what I expect. If I had switched the items, PHP would have complained as I tried to assign an object to a non-variable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I updated this website to D7 this weekend. <a href="http://mikkel.hoegh.org/blog/2010/oct/7/relaunching-blog-drupal-7" title="Relauching my blog on Drupal 7 | Mikkel Høgh">Mikkel</a> upgraded his site and urges others to do so now, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot too. And it was good fun! OK, granted, this site is 4 posts and pretty much nothing else, but that makes it a perfect time to upgrade.</p>

<p>I actually never did an actual core upgrade via the upgrade path before. The sites I have upgraded from D5 to D6 have pretty much all had such a complex data structure that I had to do an upgrade with a data migration. While that is a lot of work (and requires a programmer), I still like the opportunity it gives to clear out a data model that might have grown a little too organically. For this site though, that would be gross overkill. So my approach was simply to read UPGRADE.txt and follow the steps.</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use any of the big modules like CCK, views or panels. In fact I ended up with only 3 enabled contrib modules.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
  On D6 I had a tag cloud that the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic" title="Tagadelic | drupal.org">tagadelic module</a> made, but I simply removed that because I couldn&rsquo;t see a 7.x branch on d.o. It turns out that there is work in progress to port it, so in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/749440" title="Any plans for a Drupal 7 release / upgrade / version ? | drupal.org">this issue</a> I found that <a href="http://github.com/mscharley/tagadelic/tree/DRUPAL-7--1" title="mscharley">development is going on github</a>. I really like that module so I might take a look and see if I can help.
</li>
<li>
  The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/twitter" title="Twitter | drupal.org">twitter module</a> does not have a 7.x branch either, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/780712" title="Drupal 7 port of Twitter module | drupal.org">but there is work going on</a>. I decided to go for the easy choice so far and just this <a href="http://twitter.com/goodies/widget_profile">twitter-widget</a> and embed the code in a block. In fact for my need that is just fine.
</li>
<li>
  I have always loved the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu" title="Administration menu | drupal.org">admin_menu module</a> even though the fancy menu that sits on the side and awaits your click in rubik is nifty, I still like the overview that admin_menu gives me better. Luckily there is a 7.x branch and it also packs a neat integration with the top toolbar that D7 ships with.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics" title="Google Analytics | drupal.org">Google analytics</a> has a 7.x branch and I had no trouble with that other than some problem with actually writing the tracking codes. But it turned out that the theme was not doing that.
</li>
<li>
  The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mollom" title="Mollom | drupal.org">Mollom module</a> was not working, but I think I upgraded it wrong. As soon as I uninstalled it and installed it again it was fine. It threw errors at me when I enabled it after the core upgrade, so I must have missed something there.
</li>
I use <a href="http://illuminex.com/ecto/" title="illumineX :: ecto - blog editor for Mac OS X">ecto</a> as a blogging client for my D6 sites. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blogapi" title="Blog API | drupal.org">blog API</a> module was taken out of D7 and now <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blogapi" title="Blog API | drupal.org">lives on its own here</a>. I tried to make it work, but I can see that it will take me some time. I will have to spend more time playing with that.</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>I really like the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/corolla" title="Corolla | drupal.org">Corolla theme</a>. I knew I wanted to use that so I didn&rsquo;t even browse around for a D7 theme. Configuring color and all that was easy, and the only problem I ran into was the theme <a href="http://drupal.org/node/945124" title="Footer is not output anywhere | drupal.org">not printing the footer</a> with the google analytics tracking codes.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s it like?</h3>

<p>I like D7. A lot. I have been playing around with it for a long time, but always with test data, the standard theme, and not so many contrib modules. It&rsquo;s great to see it all come together. One thing that took me a long time to get used to is the overlay. At first I hated it, but during the last 6 months or so it&rsquo;s grown on me. I am still not sure I would keep it enabled on any site, but it gets a chance on my site for now.</p>

<p>Another thing in D7 that really threw me off during the upgrade was that the core modules are listed first on the modules page. For a while I thought that drupal was just not finding my contrib modules. I would probably put them at the bottom if I was to sort them other than alphabetically.</p>

<p>I am excited to finally run Drupal 7! And I can&rsquo;t wait to play with more contrib modules more and see what cool stuff comes out of all the new opportunities in D7.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate">backup and migrate</a> module is truly sweet. We all know that it is a <em>really</em> good idea to back up data. But if you are like me &ndash; you forgot to do it or just don&rsquo;t do it for some lame reason. So backups should be automated. The backup and migrate module does exactly that &ndash; it can be configured to run every X hours if you have cron (and you should have) running on your site. <br/>
The module makes a dump of the database and puts it in a folder in the files folder of the site. Even if you use the public <a href="http://drupal.org/node/22240">download method</a>, the security is OK &ndash; a .htacces file put in the folder by the backup and migrate module and dissalows access to the folder&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that my server goes up in flames, I like to have some backups that are not physically on the same server as the site. I really like Dropbox, so I thought I would figure out a way to use that for the database dumps. I found this very <a href="http://jaka.kubje.org/software/dropboxuploader/">nice and simple php script</a>, that will upload files to your dropbox. I used that to write a super simple php file that my cronjob will call once a day. I settled with having daily backups a week back in time, so the filenames are day names. That way monday&rsquo;s file will be overwritten next monday.</p>

<p>Here is what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable the backup migrate module</li>
<li>Go to yoursite.com/admin/content/backup_migrate/export and choose gz under compression, put your sitename in <em>Backup file name</em>, and put &ldquo;D&rdquo; for dayname under Timestamp format:<br/>
<img class="center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157691/cdn/naxocnet/timestamp_append.png"></li>
<li>Download and unzip the latest <a href="http://jaka.kubje.org/software/dropboxuploader/">Dropbox uploader</a> (I used the 1.1.5 version)</li>
<li>Edit the variables capitalized in the php below and save the it to a file called dropbox_backup.php. Put it next to the Dropbox uploader file. The files should be put somewhere outside the drupal installation.</li>
<li>Put a line that in your crontab that calls the php script. It could look like this one, that will run every night at 1 and report to a log file how it went.
<code>00 01 * * * php PATH_TO_SCRIPT/dropbox_backup.php &gt;&gt; PATH_TO_SCRIPT/log.txt</code>
And that&rsquo;s it! Easy backup of your database and easy use of the ample storage space that Dropbox offers.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If one goes to somedrupalsite.com/CHANGELOG.txt &ndash; it is normally possible to read the file and see what version of Drupal the site is running. If you don&rsquo;t want everybody to see what version you are running, it is a good idea to cloak the *.txt files in the Drupal install.</p>

<p>Using rewrite rules in .htaccess, the *.txt files in Drupal can be hidden. I use a 403 &ndash; forbidden on these files. That is what the [F] means See the Apache documentation on RewriteRule for more options.</p>

<p>Put these lines in the bottom of the .htaccess file, but before the <code>&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code> &ldquo;tag&rdquo;. The .htaccess file lives in the root of your Drupal installation.</p>

<h2>Using version control?</h2>

<p>Metadata folders left by whatever version control system should be hidden too.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Don't let people pry in version control folders
</span><span class='line'>RewriteRule (^|/)(CVS|\.svn|\.git)/ - [F]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Put the above snippet inside the <code>&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code> in .htaccess as well.</p>
