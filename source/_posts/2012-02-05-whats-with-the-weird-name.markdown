So, Camilla.. Why is your nick everywhere _naxoc_?.

Xoc means shark in Yucatec Maya. It might actually be [one of the very few words that made it into English]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec_Maya_language#English_words_derived_from_Maya"). I used to study American Indian Language and Culture at the University of Copenhagen. Those were the days with much nerding over Mayan hieroglyphics. Maya hieroglyphic texts are often about how fantastic the rulers where and one of the more fantastic female rulers was called [Lady Xoc]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Xoc"). I thought she was pretty cool, so I stole the name. The Na- prefix is simply a marker for female. So there is the story of my weird nick.

It is pronounced “nashoc”.
