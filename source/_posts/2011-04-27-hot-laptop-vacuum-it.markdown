My beloved 3years old Macbook Pro was starting to get really hot when I used it. It had gotten to the point where I would burn my legs if it was on my lap, and since having your *lap*top on the lap is kinda the point, I felt had to do something about it.

I bought a [Logitech Notebook Cooling Pad](“http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Notebook-Cooling-N100-Gray/dp/B003BEDQYY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1303933766&sr=8-1”) that actually is very comfortable and does exactly as it says it will, but I was still curious to see if I could get my old healthy Macbook back.

I found [this blog post](“http://www.andrew.co.za/2008/02/quick-macbook-clean.html”) about how to vacuum the laptop and the result is amazing. I was a little worried about the static, so I turned the machine completely off and removed the battery before vacuuming. The happy laptop is now quieter and cooler! Very simple and very recommended.
