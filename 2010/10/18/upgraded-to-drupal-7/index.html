<div class="entry-content"><p>I updated this website to D7 this weekend. <a href="http://mikkel.hoegh.org/blog/2010/oct/7/relaunching-blog-drupal-7" title="Relauching my blog on Drupal 7 | Mikkel HÃ¸gh">Mikkel</a> upgraded his site and urges others to do so now, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot too. And it was good fun! OK, granted, this site is 4 posts and pretty much nothing else, but that makes it a perfect time to upgrade.</p>

<p>I actually never did an actual core upgrade via the upgrade path before. The sites I have upgraded from D5 to D6 have pretty much all had such a complex data structure that I had to do an upgrade with a data migration. While that is a lot of work (and requires a programmer), I still like the opportunity it gives to clear out a data model that might have grown a little too organically. For this site though, that would be gross overkill. So my approach was simply to read UPGRADE.txt and follow the steps.</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use any of the big modules like CCK, views or panels. In fact I ended up with only 3 enabled contrib modules.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
  On D6 I had a tag cloud that the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic" title="Tagadelic | drupal.org">tagadelic module</a> made, but I simply removed that because I couldn&rsquo;t see a 7.x branch on d.o. It turns out that there is work in progress to port it, so in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/749440" title="Any plans for a Drupal 7 release / upgrade / version ? | drupal.org">this issue</a> I found that <a href="http://github.com/mscharley/tagadelic/tree/DRUPAL-7--1" title="mscharley">development is going on github</a>. I really like that module so I might take a look and see if I can help.
</li>
<li>
  The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/twitter" title="Twitter | drupal.org">twitter module</a> does not have a 7.x branch either, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/780712" title="Drupal 7 port of Twitter module | drupal.org">but there is work going on</a>. I decided to go for the easy choice so far and just this <a href="http://twitter.com/goodies/widget_profile">twitter-widget</a> and embed the code in a block. In fact for my need that is just fine.
</li>
<li>
  I have always loved the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu" title="Administration menu | drupal.org">admin_menu module</a> even though the fancy menu that sits on the side and awaits your click in rubik is nifty, I still like the overview that admin_menu gives me better. Luckily there is a 7.x branch and it also packs a neat integration with the top toolbar that D7 ships with.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics" title="Google Analytics | drupal.org">Google analytics</a> has a 7.x branch and I had no trouble with that other than some problem with actually writing the tracking codes. But it turned out that the theme was not doing that.
</li>
<li>
  The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mollom" title="Mollom | drupal.org">Mollom module</a> was not working, but I think I upgraded it wrong. As soon as I uninstalled it and installed it again it was fine. It threw errors at me when I enabled it after the core upgrade, so I must have missed something there.
</li>
I use <a href="http://illuminex.com/ecto/" title="illumineX :: ecto - blog editor for Mac OS X">ecto</a> as a blogging client for my D6 sites. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blogapi" title="Blog API | drupal.org">blog API</a> module was taken out of D7 and now <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blogapi" title="Blog API | drupal.org">lives on its own here</a>. I tried to make it work, but I can see that it will take me some time. I will have to spend more time playing with that.</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>I really like the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/corolla" title="Corolla | drupal.org">Corolla theme</a>. I knew I wanted to use that so I didn&rsquo;t even browse around for a D7 theme. Configuring color and all that was easy, and the only problem I ran into was the theme <a href="http://drupal.org/node/945124" title="Footer is not output anywhere | drupal.org">not printing the footer</a> with the google analytics tracking codes.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s it like?</h3>

<p>I like D7. A lot. I have been playing around with it for a long time, but always with test data, the standard theme, and not so many contrib modules. It&rsquo;s great to see it all come together. One thing that took me a long time to get used to is the overlay. At first I hated it, but during the last 6 months or so it&rsquo;s grown on me. I am still not sure I would keep it enabled on any site, but it gets a chance on my site for now.</p>

<p>Another thing in D7 that really threw me off during the upgrade was that the core modules are listed first on the modules page. For a while I thought that drupal was just not finding my contrib modules. I would probably put them at the bottom if I was to sort them other than alphabetically.</p>

<p>I am excited to finally run Drupal 7! And I can&rsquo;t wait to play with more contrib modules more and see what cool stuff comes out of all the new opportunities in D7.</p>
